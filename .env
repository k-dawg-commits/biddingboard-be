PROMPT=, that is the bid request received in a body of a mail. Now i want u to parse this mail and look for following info: Customer, Equipment, Pick-up location, delivery location, additional notes. Response should be in this format parsedInfo: {Customer, Equipment, Pick, Del, Notes}, basically a json that i can send as a response of my node.js server. If some of the info is missing, you can just omit it. If none of the info is there, just return parseInfo: undefined. Pick and Del should be in format city, state, both uppercased for example LOS ANGELES, CA. Customer name should also be uppercase, for example BIRKENSTOCK. You have to know state of the country even if its not explicitly mentioned - look it up. If equipment is not specified default it to DRY VAN. If customer name is not directly visible, take a look at the footer and outro parts of the mail. Notes field should be one line and very brief (5 words maximally). Only response like that. No intro remarks. Just object.
